                </div>
                
                <p>Islam is a monotheistic religion that emerged in the 7th century CE in the Arabian Peninsula. The word "Islam" comes from the Arabic root s-l-m, which means peace, safety, and submission to Allah (God). A person who practices Islam is called a Muslim, meaning "one who submits to Allah."</p>
                
                <div class="verse-box">
                    <p>وَمَا أَرْسَلْنَاكَ إِلَّا رَحْمَةً لِّلْعَالَمِينَ</p>
                    <p>And We have not sent you except as a mercy to all the worlds.</p>
                    <div class="verse-reference">— Quran 21:107</div>
                </div>
                
                <p>Islam is founded on five fundamental principles known as the Five Pillars, and Muslims believe in six articles of faith. The religion emphasizes the oneness of Allah, the prophethood of Muhammad (peace be upon him), and the importance of living a life in accordance with divine guidance.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Key Concepts in Islam:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Tawhid (Unity of Allah) - The fundamental belief in the oneness of God</li>
                        <li>Risalah (Prophethood) - The belief in divine messengers</li>
                        <li>Akhirah (Afterlife) - The belief in life after death and judgment</li>
                        <li>Submission and Peace - Living in harmony with Allah's will</li>
                    </ul>

                </div>
                
                <h2>The Meaning of Submission</h2>
                
                <p>In Islamic theology, submission to Allah does not mean passive resignation but rather an active choice to align one's life with divine guidance. This submission brings inner peace and spiritual fulfillment, as believers trust in Allah's wisdom and mercy.</p>
                
                <div class="hadith-box">

                    <h1 class="chapter-title">The Five Pillars of Islam</h1>
                </div>
                
                <p>The Five Pillars of Islam represent the foundation of Muslim life. These are the essential acts of worship and practice that define what it means to be a Muslim. Each pillar serves both as a spiritual obligation and a means of connecting with Allah and the Muslim community.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Shahada (Declaration of Faith)</h2>
                
                <div class="arabic-text">
                    لَا إِلَٰهَ إِلَّا ٱللَّٰهُ مُحَمَّدٌ رَسُولُ ٱللَّٰهِ
                </div>
                
                <p>The Shahada is the Islamic declaration of faith: "There is no god but Allah, and Muhammad is the messenger of Allah." This testimony is the foundation of Islamic belief and the gateway to becoming a Muslim.</p>
                
                <h2>2. Salah (Prayer)</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims are required to perform five daily prayers at prescribed times: Fajr (dawn), Dhuhr (midday), Asr (afternoon), Maghrib (sunset), and Isha (night). These prayers serve as a direct connection between the worshipper and Allah.</p>
                
                <div class="key-points">
                    <h3>Benefits of Regular Prayer:</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Spiritual purification and mindfulness</li>
                        <li>Regular remembrance of Allah throughout the day</li>
                        <li>Discipline and time management</li>
                        <li>Community bonding when performed in congregation</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                
                <h2>3. Zakat (Charitable Giving)</h2>
                
                <p>Zakat is the obligatory charity that Muslims must give annually, typically 2.5% of their accumulated wealth. This pillar promotes social justice and helps support the less fortunate in society.</p>
                
                <h2>4. Sawm (Fasting during Ramadan)</h2>
                
                <p>During the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims fast from dawn to sunset, abstaining from food, drink, and other physical needs. This practice develops self-discipline, empathy for the less fortunate, and spiritual awareness.</p>
                
                <h2>5. Hajj (Pilgrimage to Mecca)</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims who are physically and financially able must perform the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. This journey represents spiritual purification and unity with Muslims from around the world.</p>
                
                <div class="verse-box">
                    <p>And it is Allah's right upon the people that they perform Hajj of the House - whoever is able to find a way.</p>

                <p>The Six Articles of Faith (Arkan al-Iman) represent the core beliefs that every Muslim must hold. These beliefs form the theological foundation of Islam and guide the believer's understanding of existence, purpose, and destiny.</p>
                
                <h2>1. Belief in Allah (Tawhid)</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims believe in the absolute oneness and uniqueness of Allah. This concept, known as Tawhid, is the most fundamental aspect of Islamic theology. Allah is eternal, all-knowing, all-powerful, and the creator and sustainer of all existence.</p>
                
                <div class="verse-box">
                    <p>قُلْ هُوَ اللَّهُ أَحَدٌ ۝ اللَّهُ الصَّمَدُ ۝ لَمْ يَلِدْ وَلَمْ يُولَدْ ۝ وَلَمْ يَكُن لَّهُ كُفُوًا أَحَدٌ</p>
                    <p>Say: He is Allah, the One! Allah, the Eternal, Absolute. He begets not, nor is He begotten. And there is none like unto Him.</p>

                </div>
                
                <h2>2. Belief in Angels (Mala'ika)</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims believe in the existence of angels as beings created by Allah from light. Angels are sinless, obedient servants of Allah who carry out His commands. Notable angels include Gabriel (Jibril), who delivered revelations to the prophets.</p>
                
                <h2>3. Belief in Divine Books</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims believe that Allah revealed divine books to guide humanity throughout history. These include the Torah (Tawrat) given to Moses, the Psalms (Zabur) given to David, the Gospel (Injil) given to Jesus, and finally the Quran given to Muhammad (peace be upon him).</p>

                </div>
                
                <h2>4. Belief in Prophets and Messengers</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims believe that Allah sent prophets and messengers throughout history to guide different communities. Islam recognizes 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Quran, including Adam, Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad (peace be upon them all).</p>
                
                <h2>5. Belief in the Day of Judgment</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims believe in life after death and the Day of Judgment, when all humans will be held accountable for their actions in this world. This belief encourages moral behavior and gives meaning to earthly existence.</p>
                
                <h2>6. Belief in Divine Decree (Qadar)</h2>
                
                <p>Muslims believe in Allah's divine decree - that Allah has knowledge of all things and that nothing occurs without His will. However, this does not negate human free will and responsibility for one's actions.</p>
                
                <div class="hadith-box">

                <p>The Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri calendar, is a lunar calendar consisting of 12 months and approximately 354-355 days. It begins with the Hijra (migration) of Prophet Muhammad from Mecca to Medina in 622 CE.</p>

                <p>Observed on the 10th day of Dhul Hijjah, commemorating Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son in obedience to Allah. Muslims who can afford it sacrifice an animal and distribute the meat to family, friends, and the poor.</p>

                <p>Four months in the Islamic calendar are considered sacred: Muharram, Rajab, Dhul Qi'dah, and Dhul Hijjah. During these months, fighting was traditionally prohibited, and spiritual activities were emphasized.</p>

                <p>The use of a lunar calendar means that Islamic festivals rotate through different seasons over the years, ensuring that no particular season is permanently associated with religious observances.</p>
