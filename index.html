        <h2>1. LEXIS AND STRUCTURE</h2>
        
        <h3>1.1 Grammar Rules</h3>
        <p>English grammar consists of rules for constructing sentences and communicating effectively.</p>
        <div class="rule">
            Parts of Speech:<br>
            - Nouns: names of people, places, things, or ideas<br>
            - Verbs: action or state words<br>
            - Adjectives: words that describe nouns<br>
            - Adverbs: words that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs<br>
            - Pronouns: words that replace nouns<br>
            - Prepositions: words that show relationships between other words<br>
            - Conjunctions: words that connect words, phrases, or clauses<br>
            - Interjections: words expressing emotion
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Identifying parts of speech<br>
            "The <u>girl</u> (noun) <u>quickly</u> (adverb) <u>solved</u> (verb) the <u>difficult</u> (adjective) puzzle."<br>
            "<u>She</u> (pronoun) walked <u>through</u> (preposition) the park <u>and</u> (conjunction) met her friends. <u>Wow!</u> (interjection) It was fun."
        </div>
        <div class="tip">
            Always identify the subject and verb in a sentence first, as they form the foundation of English sentence structure.
        </div>
        
        <h3>1.2 Tenses</h3>
        <p>Tenses indicate when an action takes place: past, present, or future.</p>
        <div class="rule">
            Main Tense Groups:<br>
            - Simple: I walk / I walked / I will walk<br>
            - Continuous: I am walking / I was walking / I will be walking<br>
            - Perfect: I have walked / I had walked / I will have walked<br>
            - Perfect Continuous: I have been walking / I had been walking / I will have been walking
        </div>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Simple Present vs. Present Continuous<br>
            Simple Present (habitual action): "He <u>plays</u> football every Sunday."<br>
            Present Continuous (action in progress): "He <u>is playing</u> football right now."
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Past Perfect vs. Simple Past<br>
            Past Perfect (action completed before another past action): "I <u>had finished</u> my homework before dinner."<br>
            Simple Past (completed action): "I <u>finished</u> my homework yesterday."
        </div>
        
        <h3>1.3 Punctuation</h3>
        <p>Punctuation marks help clarify meaning and organize written text.</p>
        <div class="rule">
            Common punctuation marks:<br>
            - Period (.): ends a declarative sentence<br>
            - Comma (,): separates elements in a list or clauses<br>
            - Question mark (?): ends an interrogative sentence<br>
            - Exclamation point (!): indicates strong emotion<br>
            - Colon (:): introduces a list or explanation<br>
            - Semicolon (;): connects related independent clauses<br>
            - Apostrophe ('): shows possession or contraction<br>
            - Quotation marks (""): indicate direct speech or quotes
        </div>
        <div class="important">
            Remember that punctuation can completely change the meaning of a sentence. Compare: "Let's eat, Grandma!" versus "Let's eat Grandma!"
        </div>
        
        <h3>1.4 Common Grammatical Errors</h3>
        <p>Avoiding these common errors will improve your writing quality.</p>
        <div class="rule">
            Common errors to avoid:<br>
            - Subject-verb agreement: "The group of students <u>is</u> (not are) here."<br>
            - Pronoun-antecedent agreement: "Each student must bring <u>his or her</u> (not their) book."<br>
            - Misplaced modifiers: "Walking down the street, <u>the trees were beautiful</u>" should be "Walking down the street, <u>I saw beautiful trees</u>"<br>
            - Dangling participles: "Having finished the assignment, <u>the TV was turned on</u>" should be "Having finished the assignment, <u>I turned on the TV</u>"
        </div>

        <h2>2. COMPREHENSION AND SUMMARY</h2>
        
        <h3>2.1 Reading Comprehension</h3>
        <p>Reading comprehension involves understanding, interpreting, and analyzing written text. It requires both literal and inferential understanding of the content presented in a passage.</p>
        <p>Key reading comprehension skills include identifying the main idea, recognizing supporting details, making inferences, understanding vocabulary in context, and identifying the author's purpose and tone.</p>
        <p>When approaching a comprehension passage in the WAEC examination, it's recommended to follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Skim the passage quickly to get a general idea of the topic</li>
            <li>Read the questions to know what information to look for</li>
            <li>Read the passage carefully, making mental notes of key points</li>
            <li>Answer questions by referring back to specific parts of the text</li>
            <li>For vocabulary questions, pay attention to context clues that help determine meaning</li>
            <li>For inference questions, look for implied information rather than directly stated facts</li>
        </ol>
        
        <div class="rule">
            Types of comprehension questions:<br>
            - Literal: answers directly stated in the text<br>
            - Inferential: requires reading between the lines<br>
            - Evaluative: requires judgment based on text and personal knowledge<br>
            - Vocabulary: understanding words in context<br>
            - Main idea: identifying central theme or purpose<br>
            - Detail: identifying specific information
        </div>
        
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> Types of Questions<br>
            <strong>Passage excerpt:</strong> "Despite numerous challenges, Adeola persevered in her studies. Working two jobs and caring for her siblings, she still managed to graduate with honors."<br><br>
            <strong>Literal question:</strong> What did Adeola achieve despite her challenges?<br>
            <strong>Inferential question:</strong> What quality does Adeola demonstrate in this passage?<br>
            <strong>Evaluative question:</strong> Do you think Adeola's achievement is remarkable? Why or why not?
        </div>
        
        <h3>2.2 Summary Writing</h3>
        <p>Summary writing tests your ability to identify main points and condense information without losing essential meaning.</p>
        <div class="rule">
            Steps for effective summary writing:<br>
            1. Read the passage carefully to understand the main ideas<br>
            2. Identify key points and supporting details<br>
            3. Discard irrelevant information and examples<br>
            4. Rewrite the main points in your own words<br>
            5. Ensure your summary is concise (usually about one-third of the original)<br>
            6. Maintain the author's intended meaning<br>
            7. Use appropriate linking words for coherence
        </div>
        
        <div class="tip">
            In summary writing, focus on content points rather than examples or illustrations. Use your own words as much as possible while maintaining accuracy.
        </div>
        
        <div class="exam-tips">

            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="practice-section">
            <h4>Practice Exercise</h4>
            <p><strong>Directions:</strong> Read the following passage and practice identifying the main ideas and supporting details. Then, write a summary of about 100 words.</p>
            <p><em>Environmental pollution is one of the biggest challenges facing humanity today. Air pollution from factories and vehicles releases harmful gases into the atmosphere, contributing to respiratory diseases and climate change. Water pollution from industrial waste and agricultural runoff contaminates our rivers and oceans, harming aquatic life and affecting drinking water sources. Land pollution from improper waste disposal destroys habitats and leaches toxins into the soil. To address these issues, governments worldwide are implementing stricter regulations on emissions and waste disposal. Individuals can also contribute by reducing their carbon footprint, recycling, and properly disposing of waste. Educational institutions are raising awareness about environmental conservation. Only through collaborative efforts can we hope to create a cleaner, healthier planet for future generations.</em></p>
